# Rappler Article Scraper

This project is about creating a tool that can automatically collect information from articles on the Rappler website. The tool starts by looking at a list of articles available on the website's sitemap, which is like a directory or table of contents. Users have the option to set a limit on how many articles they want to collect information from, making the process flexible.

Once it knows which articles to look at, the tool visits each article's page, gathering important details like the title, the main content, and how readers have reacted to it. After collecting this information, the tool saves everything into a simple text file in a format called JSON, which can easily be read by humans and computers.
